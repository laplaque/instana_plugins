This release introduces significant improvements to the `--once` flag functionality, transforming it from a silent execution mode into a user-friendly debugging and testing tool with immediate console feedback.

**‚ú® New Features:**
- **Enhanced Console Output**: Displays collected metrics with visual indicators (‚úì) for success and helpful diagnostic messages (‚úó) for failures
- **Real-time Feedback**: Immediate console output without requiring log file inspection
- **Argument Validation**: Warning system alerts when `--once` and `--interval` flags conflict
- **Help Text Updates**: Clear documentation of flag interactions and behaviors
- **User Guidance**: Self-documenting command line interface

- ‚úÖ Enhanced console output for both success and failure scenarios
- ‚úÖ Argument validation with warning when `--once` and `--interval` are combined
- ‚úÖ Updated help text to clarify flag interactions and behaviors

**üìä Benefits Summary:**
- **Before v0.1.00**: Silent execution requiring log file inspection, no argument validation, confusing debugging experience
- **After v0.1.00**: Immediate visual feedback with ‚úì/‚úó indicators, clear diagnostic messages, argument validation, self-documenting interface

**üéØ Use Cases Enhanced:**
- **Debugging & Testing**: Immediate feedback for process monitoring validation

# Success case
$ python3 sensor.py --once
‚úì Successfully collected 21 metrics for 'python':
  cpu_usage: 90.2
  memory_usage: 0.37
  [... all metrics displayed]

# Failure case  
$ python3 sensor.py --once
‚úó No processes found matching 'ProcessName'
  This could mean:
  - The process is not currently running
  - The process name doesn't match the pattern
  - Permission issues accessing process information

# Argument conflict warning
$ python3 sensor.py --once --interval 30
Warning: --interval flag ignored when using --once mode
```
