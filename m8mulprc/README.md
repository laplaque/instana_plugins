# Instana MicroStrategy M8MulPrc Monitor Plugin

A custom Instana plugin for monitoring MicroStrategy M8MulPrc processes. This plugin collects process-specific metrics including CPU usage, memory usage, disk I/O, file descriptors, thread count, and context switches.

## Features

- Process-specific monitoring for MicroStrategy M8MulPrc
- Case-insensitive process detection
- Process resource usage tracking
- Easy installation with automatic configuration

## Metrics Collected

- CPU Usage
- Memory Usage
- Process Count
- Disk Read/Write Bytes
- Open File Descriptors
- Thread Count
- Voluntary/Non-voluntary Context Switches

## Requirements

- Instana Agent 1.2.0 or higher
- Python 3.6 or higher
- MicroStrategy environment with M8MulPrc processes

## Installation

Use the installation script to easily deploy the plugin:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/laplaque/instana_plugins.git
cd instana_plugins/m8mulprc

# Run the installer script
sudo ./install-instana-m8mulprc-plugin.sh


# Configuration
The installer will attempt to add the required configuration to your Instana agent. If that fails, you can manually add the following to your Instana agent configuration:

```yaml
com.instana.plugin.python:
  enabled: true
  custom_sensors:
    - id: microstrategy_m8mulprc
      path: /opt/instana/agent/plugins/custom_sensors/microstrategy_m8mulprc/sensor.py
      interval: 30000  # Run every 30 seconds
```
  
# Testing

To test if the plugin is correctly detecting M8MulPrc processes:

```bash
/opt/instana/agent/plugins/custom_sensors/microstrategy_m8mulprc/sensor.py
```

This should output JSON with the collected metrics if processes are found.
